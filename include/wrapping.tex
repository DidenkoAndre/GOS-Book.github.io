%RULES. Pls check it everytime.
%NOT WRAPPED BUT VERY EASY.
%\usepict[〈height of the textheight〉]{pictures/〈picture〉}	

%for ez text
%\mywrappict[〈number of narrow lines〉] [〈overhang〉] {〈width〉}

% IT WORKS EVERYWHERE EXCEPT LISTS and beginning of theorems!
%\addpicture[〈number of narrow lines〉]{〈exactly picture〉}[〈after line〉]{〈width of \textwidth picture will occupy〉}

%It is more complex and more cool variant than previous one.
%\InsertPict[〈number of narrow lines〉]{〈exactly picture〉}[〈after line〉]{〈width of \textwidth picture will occupy〉}
% do not forget about super function for lists: \wrapitem - just put it 

%For Theorems and smth like proof. ONE PICTURE TO ONE text box
%\addmppict[〈this partial of 3 argument picture will occupy, correction!〉]{〈exactly picture〉}{〈width of \textwidth picture will occupy〉]}〈text of theorem〉}

%SEE THE MOST POWERFUL CONSTRUCTION, but it is hard to set.
%\wrappicture[number of narrow lines of item]{textoffirstitem}[number of narrow lines in the second item]{ratio of textwidth}[text in the second item]{picture}[number of untouched lines]

% NOW IT IS USELESS, but can work if nothing helps.
%\addpictureitem[number of narrow lines]{exactly picture}{width of \textwidth will picture occupy}{text}
